# NYCERS-Pension-Data-Analysis

I made this project because I think it's important that every NYC emplyoee who puts their money into the pension knows how the pension is performing.

I used python for a simple linear ETL process that extracted the public pension data from the socrata API. Then I imported the data into SQL server for further analysis and made a Tableau dashboard that displays the general performance, equities performance and liquid assets performance. 

Here is the link to the visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dennis.f4059/viz/NYCERSPensionHoldings/OverviewDashboard
